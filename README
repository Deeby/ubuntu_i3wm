If xbacklight does not work (you are not able to keybind screen brightness in ~/.config/i3/config), please add these lines to the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file.

  Section "Device"
        Identifier  "Intel Graphics" 
        Driver      "intel"
        Option      "Backlight"  "intel_backlight"
    EndSection
    
Then proceed to restart your system for it to take effect.
You should now be able to configure keybindings for controlling your screen brightness.

You can adjust the wallpapers by using feh

feh --bg-scale /path/to/image

You can make i3 load the wallpaper on boot up by adding this line to the i3 config file

exec_always feh --bg-scale /path/to/wallpaper

You can also adjust the wallpaper for the login screen by editing the /etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf file.
Make sure that when you edit this file, you have root privileges. Use sudo for this.
Scroll towards the bottom of the file, under [greeter], find the line that says #background=
Change to this line

background=/path/to/image

Retart your system for changes to take effect.
