If xbacklight does not work (you are not able to keybind screen brightness in ~/.config/i3/config), please add these lines to the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file.

  Section "Device"
        Identifier  "Intel Graphics" 
        Driver      "intel"
        Option      "Backlight"  "intel_backlight"
    EndSection
    
Then proceed to restart your system for it to take effect.
You should now be able to configure keybindings for controlling your screen brightness.
